## Hi there 👋

<!--
**abrcode/abrcode** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭  I’m currently working on an advanced to-do application using Core Data, focusing on implementing optimized local storage solutions and database migrations.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning SwiftUI and Combine to create modern, responsive UIs and improve my app design skills. I’m also exploring the integration of AI into iOS apps.
- 🤔  I’m looking for help with understanding advanced system design principles for scalable iOS applications.
- 💬  Ask me about iOS development, Swift, SwiftUI, Core Data, and integrating AI features in apps.

- ⚡ Fun fact:  I once implemented a heavyweight migration for a Core Data-based app, ensuring live users didn’t face disruptions. It was both challenging and rewarding!
