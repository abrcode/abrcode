## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**abrcode/abrcode** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring SwiftUI and Combine while also learning Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) and Jetpack Compose.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI and Combine to create modern, responsive UIs and improve my app design skills. Iâ€™m also exploring the integration of AI into iOS apps.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding advanced system design principles for scalable iOS applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about iOS development, Swift, SwiftUI, Core Data, and integrating AI features in apps.

- âš¡ Fun fact:  I once implemented a heavyweight migration for a Core Data-based app, ensuring live users didnâ€™t face disruptions. It was both challenging and rewarding!
